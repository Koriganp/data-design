			<h1>Persona</h1>
			<img id="jared" src="images/persona.jpg" alt="Picture of Jared Mason"/>
			<p>Jared Mason is a 32 year old businessman who works for a large marketing firm. His work requires him to spend
			several days a week in different cities across the US, and sometimes overseas. He loves his job, and enjoys helping
			his clients reach the new customers in markets that they normally wouldn't appeal to. He is a real go-getter, with
			a no-nonsense attitude.</p>
			<p>Jared also enjoys taking his clients out to extravagant places to eat, because he is also a foodie. He loves fine
			dining as well as the low-key places that no one really knows about but the food loving community.</p>
